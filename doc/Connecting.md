## Connecting

To connect to Snowflake, specify a valid connection string composed of key-value pairs separated by semicolons,
i.e "\<key1\>=\<value1\>;\<key2\>=\<value2\>...".

**Note**: If the value specified in the connection string contains any signs like semicolon (`;`) or equal sign (`=`) or any phrases which can interfere with parsing the connection string,
please surround the value with double quotation marks (`""`). For example `password="=;;;=dummy==password;;"`.

The following table lists all valid connection properties:

You can set `MAXHTTPRETRIES=0` to remove the retry limit, but doing so runs the risk of the .NET driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE      | No       | Whether to keep the current session active after a period of inactivity, or to force the user to login again. If the value is `true`, Snowflake keeps the session active indefinitely, even if there is no activity from the user. If the value is `false`, the user must log in again after four hours of inactivity. The default is `false`. Setting this value overrides the server session property for the current session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| MINPOOLSIZE                    | No       | Expected minimum number of connections in pool. When you get a connection from the pool, more connections might be initialised in background to increase the pool size to `minPoolSize`. If you specify 0 or 1 there will be no attempts to create extra initialisations in background. The default value is 2. `maxPoolSize` value cannot be lower than `minPoolSize` value. The parameter is used only in a new version of connection pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| CHANGEDSESSION                 | No       | Specifies what should happen with a closed connection when some of its session variables are altered (e. g. you used `ALTER SESSION SET SCHEMA` to change the databese schema). The default behaviour is `OriginalPool` which means the session stays in the original pool. Currently no other option is possible. Parameter used only in a new version of connection pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| WAITINGFORIDLESESSIONTIMEOUT   | No       | Timeout for waiting for an idle session when pool is full. It happens when there is no idle session and we cannot create a new one because of reaching `maxPoolSize`. The default value is 30 seconds. Usage of units possible and allowed are: e. g. `1000ms` (milliseconds), `15s` (seconds), `2m` (minutes) where seconds are default for a skipped postfix. Special values: `0` - immediate fail for new connection to open when session is full. You cannot specify infinite value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| EXPIRATIONTIMEOUT              | No       | Timeout for using each connection. Connections which last more than specified timeout are considered to be expired and are being removed from the pool. The default is 1 hour. Usage of units possible and allowed are: e. g. `360000ms` (milliseconds), `3600s` (seconds), `60m` (minutes) where seconds are default for a skipped postfix. Special values: `0` - immediate expiration of the connection just after its creation.

### Password-based Authentication

The following example demonstrates how to open a connection to Snowflake. This example uses a password for authentication.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema";

    conn.Open();

    conn.Close();
}
```

<a id="sample-connection-strings"></a>

Beginning with version 2.0.18, the .NET connector uses Microsoft [DbConnectionStringBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.oledb.oledbconnection.connectionstring?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0#remarks) to follow the .NET specification for escaping characters in connection strings.

The following examples show how you can include different types of special characters in a connection string:

- To include a single quote (') character:

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test'password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a double quote (") character:

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test\"password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a semicolon (;):

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=\"test;password\";"
  );
  ```

- To include an equal sign (=):

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test=password;"
  );
  ```

  Note that previously you needed to use a double equal sign (==) to escape the character. However, beginning with version 2.0.18, you can use a single equal size.


Snowflake supports using [double quote identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax#double-quoted-identifiers) for object property values (WAREHOUSE, DATABASE, SCHEMA AND ROLES). The value should be delimited with `\"` in the connection string. The value is case-sensitive and allow to use special characters as part of the value.

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "database=\"testDB\";"
  );
  ```
- To include a `"` character as part of the value should be escaped using `\"\"`.

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "database=\"\"\"test\"\"user\"\"\";" // DATABASE => ""test"db""
  );
  ```

### Other Authentication Methods

If you are using a different method for authentication, see the examples below:

- **Key-pair authentication**

  After setting up [key-pair authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html), you can specify the
  private key for authentication in one of the following ways:

    - Specify the file containing an unencrypted private key:

      ```cs
      using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
      {
          conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

          conn.Open();

          conn.Close();
      }
      ```

      where:

        - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

    - Specify the file containing an encrypted private key:

      ```cs
      using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
      {
          conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};private_key_pwd={passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

          conn.Open();

          conn.Close();
      }
      ```

      where:

        - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.
        - `{passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey}` is the password for decrypting the private key.

    - Specify an unencrypted private key (read from a file):

      ```cs
      using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
      {
          string privateKeyContent = File.ReadAllText({pathToThePrivateKeyFile});

          conn.ConnectionString = String.Format("account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key={0};db=testdb;schema=testschema", privateKeyContent);

          conn.Open();

          conn.Close();
      }
      ```

      where:

        - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

- **OAuth**

  After setting up [OAuth](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth.html), set `AUTHENTICATOR=oauth` and `TOKEN` to the
  OAuth token in the connection string.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;authenticator=oauth;token={oauthTokenValue};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

    - `{oauthTokenValue}` is the oauth token to use for authentication.

- **Browser-based SSO**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR=externalbrowser`.
  Optionally, `USER` can be set. In that case only if user authenticated via external browser matches the one from configuration, authentication will complete.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=externalbrowser;user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

    - `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

  You can override the default timeout after which external browser authentication is marked as failed.
  The timeout prevents the infinite hang when the user does not provide the login details, e.g. when closing the browser tab.
  To override, you can provide `BROWSER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` parameter (in seconds).

- **Native SSO through Okta**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR` to the
  [URL of the endpoint for your Okta account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use.html#label-native-sso-okta),
  and set `USER` to the login name for your IdP.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator={okta_url_endpoint};user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

    - `{okta_url_endpoint}` is the URL for the endpoint for your Okta account (e.g. `https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com`).
    - `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

In v2.0.4 and later releases, you can configure the driver to connect through a proxy server. The following example configures the
driver to connect through the proxy server `myproxyserver` on port `8888`. The driver authenticates to the proxy server as the
user `test` with the password `test`:

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema;useProxy=true;proxyHost=myproxyserver;proxyPort=8888;proxyUser=test;proxyPassword=test";

    conn.Open();

    conn.Close();
}
```

The NONPROXYHOSTS property could be set to specify if the server proxy should be bypassed by an specified host. This should be defined using the full host url or including the url + `*` wilcard symbol.

Examples:

- `*` (Bypassed all hosts from the proxy server)
- `*.snowflakecomputing.com` ('Bypass all host that ends with `snowflakecomputing.com`')
- `https:\\testaccount.snowflakecomputing.com` (Bypass proxy server using full host url).
- `*.myserver.com | *testaccount*` (You can specify multiple regex for the property divided by `|`)


> Note: The nonproxyhost value should match the full url including the http or https section. The '*' wilcard could be added to bypass the hostname successfully.

- `myaccount.snowflakecomputing.com` (Not bypassed).
- `*myaccount.snowflakecomputing.com` (Bypassed).
