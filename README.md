[Coding conventions](CodingConventions.md).

# Building the Package

You can build Snowflake .NET connector applications for Window, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. For information about supported operating system versions, refer to the [Client Versions and Support Policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/requirements).

## Prerequisites

This project is developed under Visual Studio 2017. Earlier versions of Visual Studio are not supported.

## Steps

Prerequisites: Install dotnet, git, nuget, and mono (Only on Mac)

1. Check out the source code from GitHub:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
git clone git@github.com:snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net snowflake-connector-net
```

2. Pull down the dependency:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
cd snowflake-connector-net
nuget restore
```

3. Build the solution file
- To build the connector only:
```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
cd Snowflake.Data
dotnet build --configuration Release
```
- To build the connector and test project:
```
Add a parameters.json file to Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet build
```

# Installing the Package

Package ID for Snowflake Connector for .Net is Snowflake.Data.

Packages can be directly downloaded from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

It can also be downloaded using Visual Studio UI (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution and search for "Snowflake.Data")

Alternatively, packages can also be downloaded using Package Manager Console:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
PM> Install-Package Snowflake.Data
```

# Testing the Connector

Before running tests, create a parameters.json file under Snowflake.Data.Tests\ directory. In this file, specify username, password and account info that tests will run against. Here is a sample parameters.json file

```
{
  "testconnection": {
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_USER": "snowman",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_PASSWORD": "XXXXXXX",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ACCOUNT": "TESTACCOUNT",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_WAREHOUSE": "TESTWH",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_DATABASE": "TESTDB",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_SCHEMA": "TESTSCHEMA",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ROLE": "TESTROLE",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_HOST": "testaccount.snowflakecomputing.com"
  }
}
```

## Command Prompt

The build solution file builds the connector and tests binaries. Issue the following command from the command line to run the tests. The test binary is located in the Debug directory if you built the solution file in Debug mode.

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -f net6.0 -l "console;verbosity=normal"
```

Tests can also be run under code coverage:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
dotnet-coverage collect "dotnet test --framework net6.0 --no-build -l console;verbosity=normal" --output net6.0_coverage.xml --output-format cobertura --settings coverage.config
```

You can run only specific suite of tests (integration or unit).

Running unit tests:

```bash
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=normal" --filter FullyQualifiedName~UnitTests -l console;verbosity=normal
```

Running integration tests:

```bash
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=normal" --filter FullyQualifiedName~IntegrationTests
```

## Visual Studio 2017

Tests can also be run under Visual Studio 2017. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017 and run tests using Test Explorer.

# Usage

## Create a Connection

To connect to Snowflake, specify a valid connection string composed of key-value pairs separated by semicolons,
i.e "\<key1\>=\<value1\>;\<key2\>=\<value2\>...".

**Note**: If the keyword or value contains an equal sign (=), you must precede the equal sign with another equal sign. For example, if the keyword is "key" and the value is "value_part1=value_part2", use "key=value_part1==value_part2".

The following table lists all valid connection properties:
<br />

| Connection Property            | Required | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| MAXHTTPRETRIES                 | No       | Maximum number of times to retry failed HTTP requests (default: 7). You can set `MAXHTTPRETRIES=0` to remove the retry limit, but doing so runs the risk of the .NET driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE      | No       | Whether to keep the current session active after a period of inactivity, or to force the user to login again. If the value is `true`, Snowflake keeps the session active indefinitely, even if there is no activity from the user. If the value is `false`, the user must log in again after four hours of inactivity. The default is `false`. Setting this value overrides the server session property for the current session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Password-based Authentication

The following example demonstrates how to open a connection to Snowflake. This example uses a password for authentication.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema";

    conn.Open();

    conn.Close();
}
```

<a id="sample-connection-strings"></a>

Beginning with version 2.0.18, the .NET connector uses Microsoft [DbConnectionStringBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.oledb.oledbconnection.connectionstring?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0#remarks) to follow the .NET specification for escaping characters in connection strings.

The following examples show how you can include different types of special characters in a connection string:

- To include a single quote (') character:

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test'password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a double quote (") character:

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test\"password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a semicolon (;):

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=\"test;password\";"
  );
  ```

- To include an equal sign (=):

  ```cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test=password;"
  );
  ```

  Note that previously you needed to use a double equal sign (==) to escape the character. However, beginning with version 2.0.18, you can use a single equal size.

### Other Authentication Methods

If you are using a different method for authentication, see the examples below:

- **Key-pair authentication**

  After setting up [key-pair authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html), you can specify the
  private key for authentication in one of the following ways:

  - Specify the file containing an unencrypted private key:

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

        conn.Open();

        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

  - Specify the file containing an encrypted private key:

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};private_key_pwd={passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

        conn.Open();

        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.
    - `{passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey}` is the password for decrypting the private key.

  - Specify an unencrypted private key (read from a file):

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        string privateKeyContent = File.ReadAllText({pathToThePrivateKeyFile});

        conn.ConnectionString = String.Format("account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key={0};db=testdb;schema=testschema", privateKeyContent);

        conn.Open();

        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    - `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

- **OAuth**

  After setting up [OAuth](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth.html), set `AUTHENTICATOR=oauth` and `TOKEN` to the
  OAuth token in the connection string.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;authenticator=oauth;token={oauthTokenValue};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  - `{oauthTokenValue}` is the oauth token to use for authentication.

- **Browser-based SSO**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR=externalbrowser`.
  Optionally, `USER` can be set. In that case only if user authenticated via external browser matches the one from configuration, authentication will complete.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=externalbrowser;user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  - `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

  You can override the default timeout after which external browser authentication is marked as failed.
  The timeout prevents the infinite hang when the user does not provide the login details, e.g. when closing the browser tab.
  To override, you can provide `BROWSER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` parameter (in seconds).

- **Native SSO through Okta**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR` to the
  [URL of the endpoint for your Okta account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use.html#label-native-sso-okta),
  and set `USER` to the login name for your IdP.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator={okta_url_endpoint};user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  - `{okta_url_endpoint}` is the URL for the endpoint for your Okta account (e.g. `https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com`).
  - `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

In v2.0.4 and later releases, you can configure the driver to connect through a proxy server. The following example configures the
driver to connect through the proxy server `myproxyserver` on port `8888`. The driver authenticates to the proxy server as the
user `test` with the password `test`:

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema;useProxy=true;proxyHost=myproxyserver;proxyPort=8888;proxyUser=test;proxyPassword=test";

    conn.Open();

    conn.Close();
}
```

## Using Connection Pools

Instead of creating a connection each time your client application needs to access Snowflake, you can define a cache of Snowflake connections that can be reused as needed. Connection pooling usually reduces the lag time to make a connection. However, it can slow down client failover to an alternative DNS when a DNS problem occurs.

The Snowflake .NET driver provides the following functions for managing connection pools.

| Function                                       | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.ClearAllPools()      | Removes all connections from the connection pool.                                                       |
| SnowflakeDbConnection.SetMaxPoolSize(n)        | Sets the maximum number of connections for the connection pool, where _n_ is the number of connections. |
| SnowflakeDBConnection.SetTimeout(n)            | Sets the number of seconds to keep an unresponsive connection in the connection pool.                   |
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize() | Returns the number of connections currently in the connection pool.                                     |
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.SetPooling()         | Determines whether to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) connecing pooling. Default: `true`.          |

The following sample demonstrates how to monitor the size of a connection pool as connections are added and dropped from the pool.

```cs
public void TestConnectionPoolClean()
{
  SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.ClearAllPools();
  SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.SetMaxPoolSize(2);
  var conn1 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn1.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
  conn1.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn1.State);

  var conn2 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn2.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + " retryCount=1";
  conn2.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn2.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(0, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  conn1.Close();
  conn2.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  var conn3 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn3.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + "  retryCount=2";
  conn3.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn3.State);

  var conn4 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn4.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + "  retryCount=3";
  conn4.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn4.State);

  conn3.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  conn4.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());

  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn1.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn2.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn3.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn4.State);
}
```

## Mapping .NET and Snowflake Data Types

The .NET driver supports the following mappings from .NET to Snowflake data types.

| .NET Framekwork Data Type | Data Type in Snowflake |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `int`, `long`             | `NUMBER(38, 0)`        |
| `decimal`                 | `NUMBER(38, <scale>)`  |
| `double`                  | `REAL`                 |
| `string`                  | `TEXT`                 |
| `bool`                    | `BOOLEAN`              |
| `byte`                    | `BINARY`               |
| `datetime`                | `DATE`                 |

## Arrow data format

The .NET connector, starting with v2.1.3, supports the [Arrow data format](https://arrow.apache.org/)
as a [preview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) feature for data transfers
between Snowflake and a .NET client. The Arrow data format avoids extra
conversions between binary and textual representations of the data. The Arrow
data format can improve performance and reduce memory consumption in clients.

The data format is controlled by the
DOTNET_QUERY_RESULT_FORMAT parameter. To use Arrow format, execute:

```snowflake
-- at the session level
ALTER SESSION SET DOTNET_QUERY_RESULT_FORMAT = ARROW;
-- or at the user level
ALTER USER SET DOTNET_QUERY_RESULT_FORMAT = ARROW;
-- or at the account level
ALTER ACCOUNT SET DOTNET_QUERY_RESULT_FORMAT = ARROW;
```

The valid values for the parameter are:

- ARROW
- JSON (default)

## Run a Query and Read Data

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = connectionString;
    conn.Open();

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "select * from t";
    IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

    while(reader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(reader.GetString(0));
    }

    conn.Close();
}
```

Note that for a `TIME` column, the reader returns a `System.DateTime` value. If you need a `System.TimeSpan` column, call the
`getTimeSpan` method in `SnowflakeDbDataReader`. This method was introduced in the v2.0.4 release.

Note that because this method is not available in the generic `IDataReader` interface, you must cast the object as
`SnowflakeDbDataReader` before calling the method. For example:

```cs
TimeSpan timeSpanTime = ((SnowflakeDbDataReader)reader).GetTimeSpan(13);
```

## Execute a query asynchronously on the server

You can run the query asynchronously on the server. The server responds immediately with `queryId` and continues to execute the query asynchronously.
Then you can use this `queryId` to check the query status or wait until the query is completed and get the results.
It is fine to start the query in one session and continue to query for the results in another one based on the queryId.

**Note**: There are 2 levels of asynchronous execution. One is asynchronous execution in terms of C# language (`async await`).
Another is asynchronous execution of the query by the server (you can recognize it by `InAsyncMode` containing method names, e. g. `ExecuteInAsyncMode`, `ExecuteAsyncInAsyncMode`).

Example of synchronous code starting a query to be executed asynchronously on the server:
```cs
using (SnowflakeDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection("account=testaccount;username=testusername;password=testpassword"))
{
      conn.Open();
      SnowflakeDbCommand cmd = (SnowflakeDbCommand)conn.CreateCommand();
      cmd.CommandText = "SELECT ...";
      var queryId = cmd.ExecuteInAsyncMode();
      // ...
}
```

Example of asynchronous code starting a query to be executed asynchronously on the server:
```cs
using (SnowflakeDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection("account=testaccount;username=testusername;password=testpassword"))
{
      await conn.OpenAsync(CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);
      SnowflakeDbCommand cmd = (SnowflakeDbCommand)conn.CreateCommand())
      cmd.CommandText = "SELECT ...";
      var queryId = await cmd.ExecuteAsyncInAsyncMode(CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);
      // ...
}
```

You can check the status of a query executed asynchronously on the server either in synchronous code:
```cs
var queryStatus = cmd.GetQueryStatus(queryId);
Assert.IsTrue(conn.IsStillRunning(queryStatus)); // assuming that the query is still running
Assert.IsFalse(conn.IsAnError(queryStatus)); // assuming that the query has not finished with error
```
or the same in an asynchronous code:
```cs
var queryStatus = await cmd.GetQueryStatusAsync(queryId, CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);
Assert.IsTrue(conn.IsStillRunning(queryStatus)); // assuming that the query is still running
Assert.IsFalse(conn.IsAnError(queryStatus)); // assuming that the query has not finished with error
```

The following example shows how to get query results.
The operation will repeatedly check the query status until the query is completed or timeout happened or reaching the maximum number of attempts.
The synchronous code example:
```cs
DbDataReader reader = cmd.GetResultsFromQueryId(queryId);
```
and the asynchronous code example:
```cs
DbDataReader reader = await cmd.GetResultsFromQueryIdAsync(queryId, CancellationToken.None).ConfigureAwait(false);
```

**Note**: GET/PUT operations are currently not enabled for asynchronous executions.

## Executing a Batch of SQL Statements (Multi-Statement Support)

With version 2.0.18 and later of the .NET connector, you can send
a batch of SQL statements, separated by semicolons,
to be executed in a single request.

**Note**: Snowflake does not currently support variable binding in multi-statement SQL requests.

---

**Note**

By default, Snowflake returns an error for queries issued with multiple statements to protect against SQL injection attacks. The multiple statements feature makes your system more vulnerable to SQL injections, and so it should be used carefully. You can reduce the risk by using the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT parameter to specify the number of statements to be executed, which makes it more difficult to inject a statement by appending to it.

---

You can execute multiple statements as a batch in the same way you execute queries with single statements, except that the query string contains multiple statements separated by semicolons. Note that multiple statements execute sequentially, not in parallel.

You can set this parameter at the session level using the following command:

```
ALTER SESSION SET MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT = <0/1>;
```

where:

- **0**: Enables an unspecified number of SQL statements in a query.

  Using this value allows batch queries to contain any number of SQL statements without needing to specify the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT statement parameter. However, be aware that using this value reduces the protection against SQL injection attacks.

- **1**: Allows one SQL statement or a specified number of statement in a query string (default).

  You must include MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT as a statement parameter to specify the number of statements included when the query string contains more than one statement. If the number of statements sent in the query string does not match the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT value, the .NET driver rejects the request. You can, however, omit this parameter if you send a single statement.

The following example sets the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT session parameter to 1. Then for an individual command, it sets MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT=3 to indicate that the query contains precisely three SQL commands. The query string, `cmd.CommandText` , then contains the three statements to execute.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
	conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
	conn.Open();
	IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
	cmd.CommandText = "ALTER SESSION SET MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT = 1;";
	cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
	conn.Close();
}

using (DbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
{
    // Set statement count
    var stmtCountParam = cmd.CreateParameter();
    stmtCountParam.ParameterName = "MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT";
    stmtCountParam.DbType = DbType.Int16;
    stmtCountParam.Value = 3;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(stmtCountParam);
    cmd.CommandText = "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test(n int); INSERT INTO test values(1), (2); SELECT * FROM test ORDER BY n;
    DbDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    do
    {
        if (reader.HasRow)
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                // read data
            }
        }
    }
    while (reader.NextResult());
}
```

## Bind Parameter

**Note**: Snowflake does not currently support variable binding in multi-statement SQL requests.

This example shows how bound parameters are converted from C# data types to
Snowflake data types. For example, if the data type of the Snowflake column
is INTEGER, then you can bind C# data types Int32 or Int16.

This example inserts 3 rows into a table with one column.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = connectionString;
    conn.Open();

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "create or replace table T(cola int)";
    int count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(0, count);

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "insert into t values (?), (?), (?)";

    var p1 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p1.ParameterName = "1";
    p1.Value = 10;
    p1.DbType = DbType.Int32;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p1);

    var p2 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p2.ParameterName = "2";
    p2.Value = 10000L;
    p2.DbType = DbType.Int32;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p2);

    var p3 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p3.ParameterName = "3";
    p3.Value = (short)1;
    p3.DbType = DbType.Int16;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p3);

    var count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(3, count);

    cmd.CommandText = "drop table if exists T";
    count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(0, count);

    conn.Close();
}
```

## Bind Array Variables

The sample code creates a table with a single integer column and then uses array binding to populate the table with values 0 to 70000.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
	conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
	conn.Open();

	using (IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
	{
		cmd.CommandText = "create or replace table putArrayBind(colA integer)";
		cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

		string insertCommand = "insert into putArrayBind values (?)";
		cmd.CommandText = insertCommand;

		int total = 70000;

		List<int> arrint = new List<int>();
		for (int i = 0; i < total; i++)
		{
			arrint.Add(i);
		}
		var p1 = cmd.CreateParameter();
		p1.ParameterName = "1";
		p1.DbType = DbType.Int16;
		p1.Value = arrint.ToArray();
		cmd.Parameters.Add(p1);

		count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); // count = 70000
	}

	conn.Close();
}
```

## PUT local files to stage

PUT command can be used to upload files of a local directory or a single local file to the Snowflake stages (named, internal table stage or internal user stage).
Such staging files can be used to load data into a table.
More on this topic: [File staging with PUT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/put).

In the driver the command can be executed in a bellow way:

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    try
    {
	    conn.ConnectionString = "<connection parameters>";
	    conn.Open();
	    var cmd = (SnowflakeDbCommand)conn.CreateCommand(); // cast allows get QueryId from the command

	    cmd.CommandText = "PUT file://some_data.csv @my_schema.my_stage AUTO_COMPRESS=TRUE";
	    var reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
	    Assert.IsTrue(reader.read());
        Assert.DoesNotThrow(() => Guid.Parse(cmd.GetQueryId()));
    }
    catch (SnowflakeDbException e)
    {
        Assert.DoesNotThrow(() => Guid.Parse(e.QueryId)); // when failed
        Assert.That(e.InnerException.GetType(), Is.EqualTo(typeof(FileNotFoundException)));
    }
```

In case of a failure a SnowflakeDbException exception will be thrown with affected QueryId if possible.
If it was after the query got executed this exception will be a SnowflakeDbException containing affected QueryId.
In case of the initial phase of execution QueryId might not be provided.
Inner exception (if applicable) will provide some details on the failure cause and
it will be for example: FileNotFoundException, DirectoryNotFoundException.

## GET stage files

GET command allows to download stage directories or files to a local directory.
It can be used in connection with named stage, table internal stage or user stage.
Detailed information on the command: [Downloading files with GET](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/get).

To use the command in a driver similar code can be executed in a client app:

```cs
    try
    {
	    conn.ConnectionString = "<connection parameters>";
	    conn.Open();
	    var cmd = (SnowflakeDbCommand)conn.CreateCommand(); // cast allows get QueryId from the command

	    cmd.CommandText = "GET @my_schema.my_stage/stage_file.csv file://local_file.csv AUTO_COMPRESS=TRUE";
	    var reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
	    Assert.IsTrue(reader.read()); // True on success, False if failure
        Assert.DoesNotThrow(() => Guid.Parse(cmd.GetQueryId()));
    }
    catch (SnowflakeDbException e)
    {
        Assert.DoesNotThrow(() => Guid.Parse(e.QueryId)); // on failure
    }
```

In case of a failure a SnowflakeDbException will be thrown with affected QueryId if possible.
When no technical or syntax errors occurred but the DBDataReader has no data to process it returns False
without throwing an exception.

## Close the Connection

To close the connection, call the `Close` method of `SnowflakeDbConnection`.

If you want to avoid blocking threads while the connection is closing, call the `CloseAsync` method instead, passing in a
`CancellationToken`. This method was introduced in the v2.0.4 release.

Note that because this method is not available in the generic `IDbConnection` interface, you must cast the object as
`SnowflakeDbConnection` before calling the method. For example:

```cs
CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource  = new CancellationTokenSource();
// Close the connection
((SnowflakeDbConnection)conn).CloseAsync(cancellationTokenSource.Token);
```

## Logging

The Snowflake Connector for .NET uses [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) as the logging framework.

Here is a sample app.config file that uses [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/)

```xml
  <configSections>
    <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net"/>
  </configSections>

  <log4net>
    <appender name="MyRollingFileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender">
      <file value="snowflake_dotnet.log" />
      <appendToFile value="true"/>
      <rollingStyle value="Size" />
      <maximumFileSize value="10MB" />
      <staticLogFileName value="true" />
      <maxSizeRollBackups value="10" />
      <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
        <!-- <header value="[DateTime]  [Thread]  [Level]  [ClassName] Message&#13;&#10;" /> -->
        <conversionPattern value="[%date] [%t] [%-5level] [%logger] %message%newline" />
      </layout>
    </appender>

    <root>
      <level value="ALL" />
      <appender-ref ref="MyRollingFileAppender" />
    </root>
  </log4net>
```

## Easy logging

The Easy Logging feature lets you change the log level for all driver classes and add an extra file appender for logs from the driver's classes at runtime. You can specify the log levels and the directory in which to save log files in a configuration file (default: `sf_client_config.json`).

You typically change log levels only when debugging your application.

**Note**
This logging configuration file features support only the following log levels:

- OFF
- ERROR
- WARNING
- INFO
- DEBUG
- TRACE

This configuration file uses JSON to define the `log_level` and `log_path` logging parameters, as follows:

```json
{
  "common": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "log_path": "c:\\some-path\\some-directory"
  }
}
```

where:

- `log_level` is the desired logging level.
- `log_path` is the location to store the log files. The driver automatically creates a `dotnet` subdirectory in the specified `log_path`. For example, if you set log_path to `c:\logs`, the drivers creates the `c:\logs\dotnet` directory and stores the logs there.

The driver looks for the location of the configuration file in the following order:

- `CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` connection parameter, containing the full path to the configuration file (e.g. `"ACCOUNT=test;USER=test;PASSWORD=test;CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=C:\\some-path\\client_config.json;"`)
- `SF_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, containing the full path to the configuration file.
- .NET driver/application directory, where the file must be named `sf_client_config.json`.
- User’s home directory, where the file must be named `sf_client_config.json`.

**Note**
To enhance security, the driver no longer searches a temporary directory for easy logging configurations. Additionally, the driver now requires the logging configuration file on Unix-style systems to limit file permissions to allow only the file owner to modify the files (such as `chmod 0600` or `chmod 0644`).

To minimize the number of searches for a configuration file, the driver reads the file only for:

- The first connection.
- The first connection with `CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` parameter.

The extra logs are stored in a `dotnet` subfolder of the specified directory, such as `C:\some-path\some-directory\dotnet`.

If a client uses the `log4net` library for application logging, enabling easy logging affects the log level in those logs as well.

## Notice

1.  CVE-2019-0820 -  
    This CVE has been reported in systems.text.regularexpressions.dll which is used by the regular expressions packages - systems.text.regularexpressions.4.3.1.nupkg. This vulnerability manifests itself ONLY when the following .NET runtime environments are being used:

        * v1.0 branch: 1.0 - 1.0.16 (exclusive)
        * v1.1 branch: 1.1 - 1.1.13 (exclusive)
        * v2.1 branch: 2.1 - 2.1.11 (exclusive)
        * v2.2 branch: 2.2 - 2.2.5  (exclusive)

        In order to mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend to update to higher Runtime versions. If you're already running on a .NET Runtime version higher than the ones listed above, you're not going to be affected by this vulnerability.

2.  Logging -  
    Snowflake has identified an issue on Feb 20, 2020, with our logging code for the .NET drivers in which we write Master and Session tokens in the clear to the debug logs. The debug logs are collected locally on the drive where your programs are running. This issue impacts only those instances where the programs are run with debug flags enabled, i.e. setting the log level value= "Debug” or “All" in the log4Net config

    Under normal conditions, the Master and Session tokens captured in the log files are short-lived for about 4 and 1 hours, respectively. They will expire after the 4-hour window unless explicitly refreshed, in which case they could be refreshed indefinitely.

    If you are using the .NET driver please take the following action:

    - Upgrade to the latest version(v1.1.0) as soon as possible.
    - Remove all “Debugging” options for any existing .NET drivers in use.
    - Delete any logs collected thus far and make sure that all copies are deleted.
    - If you cannot upgrade for any reason, please ensure all debugging is disabled

    Snowflake has identified an issue where the driver is globally enforcing TLS 1.2 and certificate revocation checks with the .NET Driver v1.2.1 and earlier versions.  
    Starting with v2.0.0, the driver will set these locally.

Note that the driver is now targeting .NET 6.0. When upgrading, you might also need to run “Update-Package -reinstall” to update the dependencies.
