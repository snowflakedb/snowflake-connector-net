Coding conventions for the project
==================================

If you would like to contribute to this project, please get to know coding conventions we would like to follow:
[Coding conventions](CodingConventions.md).

Building the Package
====================

You can build Snowflake .NET connector applications for Window, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. For information about supported operating system versions, refer to the [Client Versions and Support Policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/requirements).

Prerequisites
-------------

This project is developed under Visual Studio 2017. Earlier versions of Visual Studio are not supported.

Steps
-----

1. Check out the source code from GitHub:
```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
git clone git@github.com:snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net snowflake-connector-net
```

2. Pull down the dependency:
```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
cd snowflake-connector-net
nuget restore
```

3. Build the solution file 
```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
msbuild snowflake-connector-net.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

Installing the Package
======================

Package ID for Snowflake Connector for .Net is Snowflake.Data. 

Packages can be directly downloaded from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/). 

It can also be downloaded using Visual Studio UI (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution and search for "Snowflake.Data")

Alternatively, packages can also be downloaded using Package Manager Console:
```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
PM> Install-Package Snowflake.Data
```

Testing the Connector
=====================

Before running tests, create a parameters.json file under Snowflake.Data.Tests\ directory. In this file, specify username, password and account info that tests will run against. Here is a sample parameters.json file
```
{
  "testconnection": {
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_USER": "snowman",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_PASSWORD": "XXXXXXX",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ACCOUNT": "TESTACCOUNT",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_WAREHOUSE": "TESTWH",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_DATABASE": "TESTDB",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_SCHEMA": "TESTSCHEMA",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ROLE": "TESTROLE",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_HOST": "testaccount.snowflakecomputing.com"
  }
}
```

Command Prompt
--------------
The build solution file builds the connector and tests binaries. Issue the following command from the command line to run the tests. The test binary is located in the Debug directory if you built the solution file in Debug mode. 

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -f net6.0 -l "console;verbosity=normal"
```


Tests can also be run under code coverage:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name}
dotnet-coverage collect "dotnet test --framework net6.0 --no-build -l console;verbosity=normal" --output net6.0_coverage.xml --output-format cobertura --settings coverage.config
```

You can run only specific suite of tests (integration or unit).

Running unit tests:

```bash
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=normal" --filter FullyQualifiedName~UnitTests -l console;verbosity=normal
```

Running integration tests:

```bash
cd Snowflake.Data.Tests
dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=normal" --filter FullyQualifiedName~IntegrationTests
```

Visual Studio 2017
------------------
Tests can also be run under Visual Studio 2017. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017 and run tests using Test Explorer.


Usage
=====

Create a Connection
-------------------

To connect to Snowflake, specify a valid connection string composed of key-value pairs separated by semicolons, 
i.e "\<key1\>=\<value1\>;\<key2\>=\<value2\>...".

**Note**: If the keyword or value contains an equal sign (=), you must precede the equal sign with another equal sign. For example, if the keyword is "key" and the value is "value_part1=value_part2", use "key=value_part1==value_part2".

The following table lists all valid connection properties:
<br />

| RETRY_TIMEOUT                  | No       | Total timeout in seconds for supported endpoints of retry policy. The default is 300 seconds. The value can only be increased from the default value or set to 0 for infinite timeout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MAXHTTPRETRIES                 | No       | Maximum number of times to retry failed HTTP requests (default: 7). You can set `MAXHTTPRETRIES=0` to remove the retry limit, but doing so runs the risk of the .NET driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE      | No       | Whether to keep the current session active after a period of inactivity, or to force the user to login again. If the value is `true`, Snowflake keeps the session active indefinitely, even if there is no activity from the user. If the value is `false`, the user must log in again after four hours of inactivity. The default is `false`. Setting this value overrides the server session property for the current session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DISABLERETRY                   | No       | Set this property to `true` to prevent the driver from reconnecting automatically when the connection fails or drops. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| MINPOOLSIZE                    | No       | Expected minimum number of connections in pool. When you get a connection from the pool, more connections might be initialised in background to increase the pool size to `minPoolSize`. If you specify 0 or 1 there will be no attempts to create extra initialisations in background. The default value is 2. `maxPoolSize` value cannot be lower than `minPoolSize` value. The parameter is used only in a new version of connection pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| CHANGEDSESSION                 | No       | Specifies what should happen with a closed connection when some of its session variables are altered (e. g. you used `ALTER SESSION SET SCHEMA` to change the databese schema). The default behaviour is `OriginalPool` which means the session stays in the original pool. Currently no other option is possible. Parameter used only in a new version of connection pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| WAITINGFORIDLESESSIONTIMEOUT   | No       | Timeout for waiting for an idle session when pool is full. It happens when there is no idle session and we cannot create a new one because of reaching `maxPoolSize`. The default value is 30 seconds. Usage of units possible and allowed are: e. g. `1000ms` (milliseconds), `15s` (seconds), `2m` (minutes) where seconds are default for a skipped postfix. Special values: `0` - immediate fail for new connection to open when session is full. You cannot specify infinite value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| EXPIRATIONTIMEOUT              | No       | Timeout for using each connection. Connections which last more than specified timeout are considered to be expired and are being removed from the pool. The default is 1 hour. Usage of units possible and allowed are: e. g. `360000ms` (milliseconds), `3600s` (seconds), `60m` (minutes) where seconds are default for a skipped postfix. Special values: `0` - immediate expiration of the connection just after its creation. Expiration timeout cannot be set to infinity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Password-based Authentication

The following example demonstrates how to open a connection to Snowflake. This example uses a password for authentication.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema";

    conn.Open();
    
    conn.Close();
}
```

<a id="sample-connection-strings"></a>

Beginning with version 2.0.18, the .NET connector uses Microsoft [DbConnectionStringBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.oledb.oledbconnection.connectionstring?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0#remarks) to follow the .NET specification for escaping characters in connection strings. 

The following examples show how you can include different types of special characters in a connection string:

- To include a single quote (') character:

  ``` cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test'password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a double quote (") character:

  ``` cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test\"password;"
  );
  ```

- To include a semicolon (;):

  ``` cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=\"test;password\";"
  );
  ```

- To include an equal sign (=):

  ``` cs
  string connectionString = String.Format(
    "account=testaccount; " +
    "user=testuser; " +
    "password=test=password;"
  );
  ```

  Note that previously you needed to use a double equal sign (==) to escape the character. However, beginning with version 2.0.18, you can use a single equal size.

### Other Authentication Methods 

If you are using a different method for authentication, see the examples below:

* **Key-pair authentication**

  After setting up [key-pair authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html), you can specify the
  private key for authentication in one of the following ways:

  * Specify the file containing an unencrypted private key:

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

        conn.Open();
    
        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    * `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

  * Specify the file containing an encrypted private key:

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key_file={pathToThePrivateKeyFile};private_key_pwd={passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

        conn.Open();
    
        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    * `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.
    * `{passwordForDecryptingThePrivateKey}` is the password for decrypting the private key.

  * Specify an unencrypted private key (read from a file):

    ```cs
    using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
    {
        string privateKeyContent = File.ReadAllText({pathToThePrivateKeyFile});

        conn.ConnectionString = String.Format("account=testaccount;authenticator=snowflake_jwt;user=testuser;private_key={0};db=testdb;schema=testschema", privateKeyContent);

        conn.Open();
    
        conn.Close();
    }
    ```

    where:

    * `{pathToThePrivateKeyFile}` is the path to the file containing the unencrypted private key.

* **OAuth**

  After setting up [OAuth](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth.html), set `AUTHENTICATOR=oauth` and `TOKEN` to the
  OAuth token in the connection string.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;authenticator=oauth;token={oauthTokenValue};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();
    
      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  * `{oauthTokenValue}` is the oauth token to use for authentication.

* **Browser-based SSO**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR=externalbrowser`.
  Optionally, `USER` can be set. In that case only if user authenticated via external browser matches the one from configuration, authentication will complete.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator=externalbrowser;user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  * `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

  You can override the default timeout after which external browser authentication is marked as failed.
  The timeout prevents the infinite hang when the user does not provide the login details, e.g. when closing the browser tab.
  To override, you can provide `BROWSER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` parameter (in seconds).


* **Native SSO through Okta**

  In the connection string, set `AUTHENTICATOR` to the
  [URL of the endpoint for your Okta account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use.html#label-native-sso-okta),
  and set `USER` to the login name for your IdP.

  ```cs
  using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
  {
      conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;authenticator={okta_url_endpoint};user={login_name_for_IdP};db=testdb;schema=testschema";

      conn.Open();

      conn.Close();
  }
  ```

  where:

  * `{okta_url_endpoint}` is the URL for the endpoint for your Okta account (e.g. `https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com`).
  * `{login_name_for_IdP}` is your login name for your IdP.

In v2.0.4 and later releases, you can configure the driver to connect through a proxy server. The following example configures the
driver to connect through the proxy server `myproxyserver` on port `8888`. The driver authenticates to the proxy server as the
user `test` with the password `test`:

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = "account=testaccount;user=testuser;password=XXXXX;db=testdb;schema=testschema;useProxy=true;proxyHost=myproxyserver;proxyPort=8888;proxyUser=test;proxyPassword=test";

    conn.Open();
    
    conn.Close();
}
```

Using Connection Pools
----------------------

Instead of creating a connection each time your client application needs to access Snowflake, you can define a cache of Snowflake connections that can be reused as needed. Connection pooling usually reduces the lag time to make a connection. However, it can slow down client failover to an alternative DNS when a DNS problem occurs.

The Snowflake .NET driver provides the following functions for managing connection pools.

| Function | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.ClearAllPools() | Removes all connections from the connection pool. |
| SnowflakeDbConnection.SetMaxPoolSize(n) | Sets the maximum number of connections for the connection pool, where _n_ is the number of connections. |
| SnowflakeDBConnection.SetTimeout(n) | Sets the number of seconds to keep an unresponsive connection in the connection pool.|
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize() | Returns the number of connections currently in the connection pool. |
| SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.SetPooling() | Determines whether to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) connecing pooling. Default: `true`.|

The following sample demonstrates how to monitor the size of a connection pool as connections are added and dropped from the pool.

```cs
public void TestConnectionPoolClean()
{
  SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.ClearAllPools();
  SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.SetMaxPoolSize(2);
  var conn1 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn1.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
  conn1.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn1.State);

  var conn2 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn2.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + " retryCount=1";
  conn2.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn2.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(0, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  conn1.Close();
  conn2.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  var conn3 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn3.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + "  retryCount=2";
  conn3.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn3.State);

  var conn4 = new SnowflakeDbConnection();
  conn4.ConnectionString = ConnectionString + "  retryCount=3";
  conn4.Open();
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Open, conn4.State);

  conn3.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());
  conn4.Close();
  Assert.AreEqual(2, SnowflakeDbConnectionPool.GetCurrentPoolSize());

  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn1.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn2.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn3.State);
  Assert.AreEqual(ConnectionState.Closed, conn4.State);
}
```

Mapping .NET and Snowflake Data Types
-------------------------------------

The .NET driver supports the following mappings from .NET to Snowflake data types.


| .NET Framekwork Data Type | Data Type in Snowflake |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `int`, `long`                 | `NUMBER(38, 0)`        |
| `decimal`                       | `NUMBER(38, <scale>)`  |
| `double` | `REAL` |
| `string` | `TEXT` |
| `bool` | `BOOLEAN` |
| `byte` | `BINARY` |
| `datetime` | `DATE` |


Run a Query and Read Data
-------------------------

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = connectionString;
    conn.Open();

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "select * from t";
    IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

    while(reader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(reader.GetString(0));
    }

    conn.Close();
}
```

Note that for a `TIME` column, the reader returns a `System.DateTime` value. If you need a `System.TimeSpan` column, call the
`getTimeSpan` method in `SnowflakeDbDataReader`. This method was introduced in the v2.0.4 release.

Note that because this method is not available in the generic `IDataReader` interface, you must cast the object as
`SnowflakeDbDataReader` before calling the method. For example:

```cs
TimeSpan timeSpanTime = ((SnowflakeDbDataReader)reader).GetTimeSpan(13);
```

Executing a Batch of SQL Statements (Multi-Statement Support)
--------------------------------------------------------------

With version 2.0.18 and later of the .NET connector, you can send
a batch of SQL statements, separated by semicolons,
to be executed in a single request.

---
**Note**

By default, Snowflake returns an error for queries issued with multiple statements to protect against SQL injection attacks. The multiple statements feature makes your system more vulnerable to SQL injections, and so it should be used carefully. You can reduce the risk by using the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT parameter to specify the number of statements to be executed, which makes it more difficult to inject a statement by appending to it.

---

You can execute multiple statements as a batch in the same way you execute queries with single statements, except that the query string contains multiple statements separated by semicolons. Note that multiple statements execute sequentially, not in parallel.

You can set this parameter at the session level using the following command:

```
ALTER SESSION SET MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT = <0/1>;
```

where:

- **0**: Enables an unspecified number of SQL statements in a query. 

    Using this value allows batch queries to contain any number of SQL statements without needing to specify the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT statement parameter. However, be aware that using this value reduces the protection against SQL injection attacks.

- **1**: Allows one SQL statement or a specified number of statement in a query string (default).

    You must include MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT as a statement parameter to specify the number of statements included when the query string contains more than one statement. If the number of statements sent in the query string does not match the  MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT value, the .NET driver rejects the request. You can, however, omit this parameter if you send a single statement.

The following example sets the MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT session parameter to 1. Then for an individual command, it sets MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT=3 to indicate that the query contains precisely three SQL commands. The query string, `cmd.CommandText` , then contains the three statements to execute.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
	conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
	conn.Open();
	IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
	cmd.CommandText = "ALTER SESSION SET MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT = 1;";
	cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
	conn.Close();
}

using (DbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
{
    // Set statement count
    var stmtCountParam = cmd.CreateParameter();
    stmtCountParam.ParameterName = "MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT";
    stmtCountParam.DbType = DbType.Int16;
    stmtCountParam.Value = 3;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(stmtCountParam);
    cmd.CommandText = "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test(n int); INSERT INTO test values(1), (2); SELECT * FROM test ORDER BY n;
    DbDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    do
    {
        if (reader.HasRow)
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                // read data
            }
        }
    }
    while (reader.NextResult());
}
```



Bind Parameter
--------------

This example shows how bound parameters are converted from C# data types to
Snowflake data types. For example, if the data type of the Snowflake column
is INTEGER, then you can bind C# data types Int32 or Int16.

This example inserts 3 rows into a table with one column.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
    conn.ConnectionString = connectionString;
    conn.Open();

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "create or replace table T(cola int)";
    int count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(0, count);

    IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "insert into t values (?), (?), (?)";

    var p1 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p1.ParameterName = "1";
    p1.Value = 10;
    p1.DbType = DbType.Int32;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p1);

    var p2 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p2.ParameterName = "2";
    p2.Value = 10000L;
    p2.DbType = DbType.Int32;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p2);

    var p3 = cmd.CreateParameter();
    p3.ParameterName = "3";
    p3.Value = (short)1;
    p3.DbType = DbType.Int16;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(p3);

    var count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(3, count);

    cmd.CommandText = "drop table if exists T";
    count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Assert.AreEqual(0, count);

    conn.Close();
}
```

Bind Array Variables
--------------------

The sample code creates a table with a single integer column and then uses array binding to populate the table with values 0 to 70000.

```cs
using (IDbConnection conn = new SnowflakeDbConnection())
{
	conn.ConnectionString = ConnectionString;
	conn.Open();

	using (IDbCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
	{
		cmd.CommandText = "create or replace table putArrayBind(colA integer)";
		cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

		string insertCommand = "insert into putArrayBind values (?)";
		cmd.CommandText = insertCommand;

		int total = 70000;

		List<int> arrint = new List<int>();
		for (int i = 0; i < total; i++)
		{
			arrint.Add(i);
		}
		var p1 = cmd.CreateParameter();
		p1.ParameterName = "1";
		p1.DbType = DbType.Int16;
		p1.Value = arrint.ToArray();
		cmd.Parameters.Add(p1);

		count = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); // count = 70000
	}

	conn.Close();
}
```

Close the Connection
--------------------

To close the connection, call the `Close` method of `SnowflakeDbConnection`.

If you want to avoid blocking threads while the connection is closing, call the `CloseAsync` method instead, passing in a
`CancellationToken`. This method was introduced in the v2.0.4 release.

Note that because this method is not available in the generic `IDbConnection` interface, you must cast the object as
`SnowflakeDbConnection` before calling the method. For example:

```cs
CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource  = new CancellationTokenSource();
// Close the connection
((SnowflakeDbConnection)conn).CloseAsync(cancellationTokenSource.Token);
```

Logging
-------
The Snowflake Connector for .NET uses [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) as the logging framework.

Here is a sample app.config file that uses [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/)

```xml
  <configSections>
    <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net"/>
  </configSections>

  <log4net>
    <appender name="MyRollingFileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender">
      <file value="snowflake_dotnet.log" />
      <appendToFile value="true"/>
      <rollingStyle value="Size" />
      <maximumFileSize value="10MB" />
      <staticLogFileName value="true" />
      <maxSizeRollBackups value="10" />
      <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
        <!-- <header value="[DateTime]  [Thread]  [Level]  [ClassName] Message&#13;&#10;" /> -->
        <conversionPattern value="[%date] [%t] [%-5level] [%logger] %message%newline" />
      </layout>
    </appender>

    <root>
      <level value="ALL" />
      <appender-ref ref="MyRollingFileAppender" />
    </root>
  </log4net>
```

Easy logging
------------

The Easy logging feature allows you to change log level of all driver's classes and add extra file appender for logs from driver's classes in runtime.
This feature was introduced to make tracing of driver's logs easier.
The feature is activated by a config file which can be:
1. provided in connection string as `CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` parameter (eg. `"ACCOUNT=test;USER=test;PASSWORD=test;CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=C:\\some-path\\client_config.json;"`)
2. provided as environmental variable called `SF_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` (eg. `SET SF_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=C:\some-path\client_config.json`)
3. found in the driver location by searching for `sf_client_config.json` file
4. found in the home location by searching for `sf_client_config.json` file
5. found in temp directory location by searching for `sf_client_config.json` file

The search for a config file is executed in the order listed above.

To minimize the number of searches for a configuration file it is executed only:
- for the first connection
- for the first connection with `CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE` parameter.

The example of the configuration file is:
```json
{
  "common": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "log_path": "c:\\some-path\\some-directory"
  }
}
```
Available log levels are: `OFF`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`. The log levels are case insensitive.

The extra logs land into `dotnet` subfolder of given directory `C:\some-path\some-directory` so in this example: `C:\some-path\some-directory\dotnet`.

If the client uses log4net library for logging in their application enabling easy logging affect the log level in their logs as well.

Notice
----------------
1. CVE-2019-0820 -  
This CVE has been reported in systems.text.regularexpressions.dll which is used by the regular expressions packages - systems.text.regularexpressions.4.3.1.nupkg. This vulnerability manifests itself ONLY when the following .NET runtime environments are being used: 

    * v1.0 branch: 1.0 - 1.0.16 (exclusive)
    * v1.1 branch: 1.1 - 1.1.13 (exclusive)
    * v2.1 branch: 2.1 - 2.1.11 (exclusive)
    * v2.2 branch: 2.2 - 2.2.5  (exclusive)

	In order to mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend to update to higher Runtime versions. If you're already running on a .NET Runtime version higher than the ones listed above, you're not going to be affected by this vulnerability. 

2. Logging -  
	Snowflake has identified an issue on Feb 20, 2020, with our logging code for the .NET drivers in which we write Master and Session tokens in the clear to the debug logs. The debug logs are collected locally on the drive where your programs are running. This issue impacts only those instances where the programs are run with debug flags enabled, i.e. setting the log level value= "Debug” or “All" in the log4Net config

	Under normal conditions, the Master and Session tokens captured in the log files are short-lived for about 4 and 1 hours, respectively. They will expire after the 4-hour window unless explicitly refreshed, in which case they could be refreshed indefinitely.

	If you are using the .NET driver please take the following action:
    * Upgrade to the latest version(v1.1.0) as soon as possible.
    * Remove all “Debugging” options for any existing .NET drivers in use.
    * Delete any logs collected thus far and make sure that all copies are deleted. 
    * If you cannot upgrade for any reason, please ensure all debugging is disabled
    * If you are concerned about a potential compromise, contact Snowflake Customer Support for assistance with invalidating all active sessions/tokens. 

3. Global HTTP connection settings -  
	Snowflake has identified an issue where the driver is globally enforcing TLS 1.2 and certificate revocation checks with the .NET Driver v1.2.1 and earlier versions.  
	Starting with v2.0.0, the driver will set these locally.  
	
  Note that the driver is now targeting .NET 6.0. When upgrading, you might also need to run “Update-Package -reinstall” to update the dependencies.
